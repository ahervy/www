## Hello, I'm Arnaud ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a technical writer** living in the cool city of Nantes, France.
Basically, I make sense of technical stuff and explain it in plain language.

**I'm also learning UX writing** to create clear, concise, and helpful conversations that enhance the whole user experience with products.

## What I do

**Making things simple:**
I make tech easy to understand.
As a technical writer, my job is to break down complex stuff and make it simple for all users.

**Collaborating with teams:**
I work with cool teams: developers, designers, product managers, and many more.
Together, we make sure that products not only work well but are also explained in a way that all users can understand.

**Crafting useful resources:**
I create various assets to help users navigate products more easily and reach their goals, including:

- step-by-step procedures
- in-product communications
- copy for the user interface
- API documentation

## Why I do it

**Empowering users:**
Good documentation is like a guide, helping users find what thay need, when they need it.
I make tech less intimidating and more user-friendly.
