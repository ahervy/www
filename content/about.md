## Hello, I'm Arnaud ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a technical writer** living in Nantes, France.
In simple terms, I decode technical stuff and explain it in plain language.

**I'm also learning UX writing** to create clear, concise, and helpful conversations that enhance the user experience with products.

## What I do

**Making things simple:**
I make tech easy to understand.
As a technical writer, my role is to break down complex stuff and make it simple for all users.

**Collaborating with teams:**
I collaborate with developers, designers, product managers, and more.
Together, we make sure that products work well and are explained in a way that all users can understand.

**Crafting useful resources:**
I create content to help users easily navigate products, including:

- Step-by-step procedures
- In-product communications
- Copy for the user interface
- API documentation

## Why I do it

**Empowering users:**
Good documentation is like a map, helping users find what they need when they need it.
I make tech less scary and more user-friendly.
