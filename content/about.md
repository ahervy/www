## Hello, I'm Arnaud ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a technical writer and UX writer** living in Nantes, France.
In simple terms, I take complicated tech stuff and explain it in a way that's easy to understand. I recently obtained my certification in UX writing to further enhance the user experience through clear, concise, and helpful conversations.

## What I do

### Making things simple

As a technical writer, I break down complex stuff and make it simple for all users.

As a UX writer, I write the words you see on apps and websites, like buttons, labels, and messages. My goal is to help users get things done easily.

### Collaborating with teams

I collaborate with developers, designers, product managers, and more.
Together, we make sure that products are easy to navigate and explained in a way that all users can understand.

### Crafting user-centered resources

I create content to help users easily navigate products, including:

- Step-by-step procedures
- In-product communications
- Copy for the user interface
- API documentation

## Why I do it

### Empowering users

I believe clear communication is key.

When things are easy to understand, users feel more in control. That's why I use both UX writing and technical writing to help users get the most out of products.
