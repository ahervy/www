## Hello, I'm Arnaud ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a technical writer** living in the cool city of Nantes, France. Basically, I make sense of technical stuff and explain it in plain language.

**I'm also learning UX writing** to craft clear, concise, and helpful conversations between the user and the product to enhance the whole user experience.

## What I do

**Making things simple:**
I'm here to make tech easy to understand. As a technical writer, my job is to break down complex stuff and make it simple for everyone.

**Collaborating with teams:**
I work with cool teams - developers, designers, product managers, and many more. Together, we make sure that our products not only work well but are also explained in a way that anyone can understand.

## Why I do it

**Empowering you:**
Good documentation is like a guide, helping you find what you need, when you need it. I'm here to make tech less intimidating and more user-friendly.
