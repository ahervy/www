This case study focuses on the creation of a [user-friendly guide](/samples/new-feature-announcement.html 'guide announcing a major navigation overhaul I created in HTML format') that helps the transition during a navigation revamp on a platform. The guide is designed to prepare users for the upcoming changes. This case study is based on my real-world experience documenting a product.

## Challenge

Our platform's complex navigation needed a complete revamp. We knew that big changes could be confusing for users. To make the transition smoother, I was tasked with creating a user-friendly guide before the release.

## Solution

1. Understanding the context: I started by reviewing the product brief. Then, I worked with product managers to understand the navigation changes and new interface terms.
2. Exploring the new navigation: I tested the new navigation on test platforms, experiencing and recording the changes.
3. Building the guide: I drafted clear descriptions of the changes and step-by-step instructions for finding features in their new location.
4. Iterating: I worked with product and marketing teams to improve the guide. We made changes to wording, screenshots, and animated GIFs based on feedback and updates to the interface.

## Results

- Empowered users: Users were informed and ready, making them more confident using the new navigation.
- Reduced support: Step-by-step guidance meant fewer users needed customer support.
- Enhanced trust: The guide became a reliable source of information, aligned with platform messaging and terminology.

## Takeaways

- Proactive communication with users is key for successful feature adoption.
- Working with subject matter experts on content creation leads to clearer content and consistent messaging.
- Testing ensures accurate and user-centric content.
