This case study focuses on the creation of [step-by-step procedures](/samples/step-by-step-procedures.html 'step-by-step procedures I created in HTML format') that guide users through tasks related to a new feature. This case study is based on my real-world experience documenting a product.

## Challenge

Our platform previously required users to rely on our Support team to manage their API keys. To empower users, we added a new feature allowing them to manage their API keys. Clear and concise instructions were crucial to ensure a smooth transition.

## Solution

1. Understanding the context and users: I started by reviewing the product brief and user stories. Then, I worked with the product manager and customer success team to understand what users already know about API keys. We found out our users were tech-savvy. So, we decided to create content on aspects like one-time visibility, revocation, and impacts.
3. Exploring the feature: I tested the feature on our platform and used Postman. I covered everything â€“ creating the API key, revoking it, and seeing how it affects integrations.
4. Building the docs: I documented all the steps using Zendesk. Then, the product manager reviewed them before publishing.

## Results

- Self-help empowerment: These docs empowered users to manage API keys faster, reducing the need for customer support.
- Step-by-step guidance: The complete set of instructions minimized errors, guiding users through the entire API key lifecycle.
- Reliable content: A thorough review with the product manager ensured accurate content users can trust.

## Takeaways

- Tailor documentation to the level of user expertise, ensuring clarity and relevance.
- Hands-on exploration ensures accurate and reliable content that meets user needs.
- Engaging with subject matter experts results in documentation that aligns with user expectations and product goals.
