[These procedures](/samples/step-by-step-procedures.html 'step-by-step procedures I created in HTML format') walk users through tasks inspired by my real-world experience documenting a product.

## Context

Our team was adding a feature to our platform that customers really wanted. Now, users could manage API keys on their own. Before that, our Support team took care of that for our customers.

## Creation of the docs

First, I read the product brief to understand the problem addressed by the feature. I also reviewed user stories and technical specifications.

Next, I worked with the product manager and customer success team to understand what users already know about API keys. We found out our users were tech-savvy.

So, we made the docs clear and concise without going into API key details. Instead, we focused on the API key only being visible once, the need for revocation, and the impacts of revoking the API key.

I tried out the feature on our platform and used Postman. I covered everything â€“ creating the API key, revoking it, and seeing how it affects integrations.

After that, I documented all the steps using Zendesk. Then, the product manager reviewed them before publishing.

## User benefits

- Self-help: These docs empowered users manage API keys faster, reducing the need for customer support.
- Step-by-step guidance: The complete set of instructions minimized errors, guiding users through API key creation, revocation, and understanding impacts.
- Quality assurance: A thorough review with the product manager ensured reliable, accurate content users can trust.
