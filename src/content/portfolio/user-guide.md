## Context

Our platform's navigation had become confusing for users due to the growing number of features. A revamp was planned to improve the user experience.

## Problem

Users risked losing key workflows during the navigation change, which could increase churn and support requests.

## My role

To help with the transition, I was tasked with creating a guide to prepare users for the upcoming navigation revamp.

## Approach

- Mapped old-to-new navigation paths and common tasks.
- Wrote a transition guide with before/after cues.
- Coordinated review with product and marketing for consistency.

## Process

1. Understanding the context: I started by reviewing the product brief. Then, I worked with product managers to understand the navigation changes and new interface concepts.
2. Exploring the new navigation: I tested the new navigation on test platforms.
3. Building the guide: I recorded and drafted step-by-step instructions for finding features in their new location.
4. Iterating: I worked with product and marketing teams to improve the wording and visuals.

## Results

- Users were informed before the release.
- Proactive communication reduced the need for customer support.
- The guide became the single source of truth for internal and external users.

## Impact

- Smoother adoption of the new navigation.
- Lower support burden during rollout.

## Takeaways

- Communicate with users before big feature releases. Such communication improves feature adoption.
- Work with subject matter experts. This way, you can know users better and create content that helps them.
- Test features and walk in the users' shoes to create accurate and suitable content.
