## Context

Users had to contact our Support team to manage their API keys, which was not convenient. To improve the user experience, we launched a feature allowing them to manage their API keys.

## My role

To support the launch of this feature, I was tasked with creating clear and concise instructions.

## Process

1. Understanding the feature and users: I started by reviewing the product brief and user stories. Then, I worked with the product manager and customer success team to understand what users know about API keys. I found out our users were tech-savvy. So, we decided to focus on aspects like one-time visibility, revocation, and impacts.
3. Exploring the feature: I tested the feature on test platforms, using Postman. From creating the API key to seeing how revocation affects integrations, I explored the whole user journey.
4. Building the content: I documented all the steps using Zendesk Guide. Then, the product manager reviewed them publishing.

## Results

- This content helped users manage API keys themselves, reducing the need for customer support.
- Reviewing the content with the product manager ensured technically accurate content for users.

## Takeaways

- Work with subject matter experts. This way, you can know users better and tailor your content to their needs.
- Test features and walk in the users' shoes to create accurate and suitable content.
