## Context

OpenWeather's Current Weather Data API is a valuable resource for developers, but its [documentation](https://openweathermap.org/current) could be improved.

## My role

My goal was to revamp the documentation to help developers integrate the API quickly and effectively.

## Process

1. Exploring the API: I created an account and tested the API using Postman to gain a deep understanding of its capabilities and limitations.
2. Taking a developer-centric approach: while testing the API, I focused on the onboarding process and learning experience for developers.
3. Analyzing the existing documentation: I identified ways to improve navigation, usability, and the developer experience.
4. Building the content:

    * I created an [OpenAPI definition](https://github.com/ahervy/api-docs/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.yaml) that describes the API.
    * I used [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) to generate the API reference documentation and an interactive playground.
    * I created a getting started guide and pages about the API, rate limits, and authentication methods.

## Results

- A getting started guide walks developers through making their first API call, reducing the onboarding time.
- An interactive playground enables developers to make API calls directly within the documentation.

## Takeaways

- Walking in the developer's shoes was crucial for identifying areas for improvement.
- Choosing the right tools streamlined the documentation process and made it more interactive.
