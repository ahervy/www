				<div class="content">
					<p>
						As a <strong>technical writer</strong>, I'm comfortable
						with tech. I turn complex info into easy-to-understand
						content for all users. Whether I create user guides,
						knowledge base articles, or API documentation, all users
						can understand the content to get the most out of
						products.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a <strong>UX writer</strong>, I write the words you
						see in apps and websites, including buttons, labels, and
						messages. My goal is to help users get things done.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm not only a writer but also an <strong>empath</strong
						>. My role is to understand what users do and need to
						provide them with useful content.
