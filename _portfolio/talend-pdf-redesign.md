### Issue

The company was refreshing its brand image.
As a result, the [current PDF deliverables](/assets/pdf/old-pdf-manual.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} have become visually outdated.

### Objective

Publishing PDF deliverables with an updated look and feel in English, French, Japanese, and Chinese (simplified).

### Solution

Enhancing the current PDF customization plugin of the DITA Open Toolkit, using XSL/XSL-FO customizations.
