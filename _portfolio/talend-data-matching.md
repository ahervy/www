### Issue

Data quality tools are quite hard to understand for new users.
The data matching process includes different phases that new users may not know.

The existing documentation was adapted to advanced users, but it was too technical for new users.

### Objective

Helping new users get started with the data matching process.

### Solution

Providing a descriptive overview of the process which includes the following elements:

- Key data matching concepts
- A description of each data matching phase
