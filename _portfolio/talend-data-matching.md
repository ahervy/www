### Issue

Data quality tools are quite hard to understand for new users. The existing documentation was adapted to advanced users, but it was too technical for new users.

### Objective

Help new users get started with the data matching process.

### Solution

Providing descriptive documentation, which includes key data matching concepts and a description of each data matching phase for new users.
