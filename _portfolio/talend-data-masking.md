## Issue

Users were confused about the behavior of some data masking functions available in the tool.

The [existing documentation](https://help.talend.com/reader/shared/960d161d-f6b3-41ed-b32e-df481bf46012/root){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} was not helpful enough itlisted only some of the functions available in the tool and did not provide many examples.

## Objective

Describe all the available functions with their specifities and provide end users with examples.

## Solution

Providing a thematically organized function reference documentation, which includes a description of each function, the availables methods, the parameters users can pass, and examples.
