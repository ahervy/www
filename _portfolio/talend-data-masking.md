### Issue

Users were confused about the behavior of some data masking functions available in the tool.

The [existing documentation](/assets/html/initial-docs-data-masking-functions.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} was not helpful enough because it listed only some of the functions available in the tool and did not provide many examples.

### Objective

Describing all the available functions with their specifities and provide end users with examples.

### Solution

Providing a thematically organized function reference documentation, which includes the following elements:

- A description of each function
- The availables methods
- The parameters users can pass
- Examples
