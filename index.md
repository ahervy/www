As a technical writer, I create technical docs to bridge the gap between people and technology.

My main goal is to **communicate complex things in a way that people can understand them**.

To reach my goal, I work closely with development and product teams to document features and help users get the most out of their products.

In other words, **I help users get the answers they need when they need them**.
