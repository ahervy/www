I'm a technical writer based in Nantes, France. I craft technical documentation to bridge the gap between people and technology.

As a technical writer, my main goal is to make complex things more simple.

I work closely with development and product teams to document features so that users can get the most out of their products. In other words, I help users get the answers they need when they need them.

To get a better understanding of what I do, check out my [portfolio]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio).
